# Project Description
The goal of this project is to create a REST API for storing and managing contacts. The API is built using the FastAPI infrastructure and uses SQLAlchemy for database management.

Contacts are stored in the database and contain the following information:

- **Name**
- **E-mail address**
- **Phone number**
- **Birthday**

The API has the ability to perform the following actions:

- *Create a new contact*
- *Get a list of all contacts*
- *Get one contact per ID*
- *Update an existing contact*
- *Delete contact*

In addition to the basic CRUD functionality, the API also has the following features:

- *Contacts are available for search by name, surname or e-mail address (Query).*
- *The API is able to retrieve a list of contacts with birthdays for the next 7 days.*
